## 6. Extract and Enter Article Data

Follow these steps for each article you wish to chart:

1. **Locate Article Details on the Radiographics Page:**
   - **Title & Author List:** These should be clearly visible on the article page.
   - **DOI:** Look for a link or label such as "DOI:" usually found near the article title or in the metadata section. If the DOI is not directly visible, it might be listed as a clickable link near the publication information.
   - **Publication Year:** This is typically mentioned alongside the DOI or in the article header; for example, it might state "Published 2019".
   - **Abstract:** Copy the abstract text from the article page.

   
   ```

2. **Clean Up the Abstract Text (if necessary):**
   - If the abstract text contains extra line breaks or spaces, copy the text and paste it into a plain text editor (such as Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on macOS set to plain text mode) to remove any extra formatting.
   - Once cleaned up, copy the text from the text editor and paste it into the Abstract column in your spreadsheet.

3. **Enter the Data:**
   - Create a new row in your spreadsheet for the article.
   - Paste the Title, Author List, DOI, Publication Year, and Abstract into their respective columns.
   - Use the drop-down menus in the **Residency Year** and **Level** columns to select the appropriate values based on the articleâ€™s metadata (for example, R1 and Basic).

## 7. Finalize Your Spreadsheet

1. **Review and Clean Up Data:**
   - Ensure each row corresponds to one article and that all details are correctly entered.
   - Delete any extra or unused rows to keep your spreadsheet neat.
2. **Enhance Visual Formatting:**
   - Bold the titles or apply additional formatting as desired to improve readability.
   - Adjust cell wrapping settings where necessary to display information clearly without unwanted breaks.
3. When all articles have been entered and the spreadsheet is formatted to your satisfaction, your data collection process is complete and ready for further processing (e.g., using Python programs).
