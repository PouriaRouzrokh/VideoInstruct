## # 3. Log Into Google Drive and Set Up Your Workspace

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to `https://drive.google.com`.
2. If you are not already logged in, enter your Google account credentials. (Depending on your setup, you might need to use a specific email or passphrase.)

```

```

## # 4. Create a New Folder for Your Project

## # 5. Create a New Google Sheet and Set It Up

1. Inside the new folder, click on the "New" button again and choose "Google Sheets" > "Blank spreadsheet".
2. Rename the spreadsheet to `Top10-Articles`.
3. In the first row of the Google Sheet, add the following column headers:
- A1: Title
- B1: Author List
- C1: DOI
- D1: Year
- E1: R Year
- F1: Level
- G1: Abstract

```

```

## # 6. Set Up Drop-Down Menus and Text Formatting

1. For the "R Year" column (column E), create a drop-down menu:
- Right-click on cell E2 and select "Data validation".
- Choose "List of items" as the criteria and enter: `R1, R2, R3, R4`.
- (Optional) Set each value to have distinct colors if desired using the formatting tools.
2. For the "Level" column (column F), create a drop-down with possible values (e.g., Basic, Intermediate, Advanced).

```

```

3. Adjust text wrapping:
- Ensure that cells (especially the Abstract column) are formatted to wrap text if necessary, or specifically set not to wrap if that suits your data cleaning preferences.

## # 7. Populate the Google Sheet With Article Data

For each article on the Radiographics page, follow these steps:

1. Switch to the browser tab with the article page (or use a split-screen setup with the Google Sheet visible).
2. Copy the article title and paste it into the Title column (e.g., cell A2).
3. Copy the author list from the article page and paste it into the Author List column (e.g., cell B2). To remove any extra spaces or hidden characters:
- Option A: Paste directly and then manually remove extra spaces.
- Option B: Paste into your browser's address bar and then copy and paste back into the spreadsheet.
4. Copy the article's DOI (which is a link) and paste it into the DOI column (e.g., cell C2).
5. Manually type or extract the publication year (e.g., `2019`) and paste it into the Year column (e.g., cell D2).
6. Use the drop-down in the "R Year" column (cell E2) to assign the residency year (e.g., R1).
7. Use the drop-down in the "Level" column (cell F2) to select the articleâ€™s level (e.g., Basic).
8. Copy the article abstract and paste it into the Abstract column (e.g., cell G2). Use the text cleaning trick:
- Paste the abstract into your browser's address bar to remove unwanted formatting and extra spaces, then copy the cleaned text and paste it into the spreadsheet.

```

```

## # 8. Repeat for All Articles

1. Return to the Radiographics website and navigate through each article category (e.g., different residency years, levels, and topics).
2. Repeat the data extraction and entry process for every article until all desired articles are charted in the Google Sheet.
3. Once completed, remove any unnecessary rows to keep the spreadsheet neat.

## # 9. Finalize and Beautify the Spreadsheet

1. Review the sheet to ensure all data is correctly entered and formatted. Bold the titles or apply any additional styling to improve readability.
2. Confirm that drop-downs are working as expected and that no extra spaces or unwanted characters remain.
3. Notify your intended audience (or simply note to yourself) that the Google Spreadsheet is ready for use in any further processing (e.g., within a Python program).

```
