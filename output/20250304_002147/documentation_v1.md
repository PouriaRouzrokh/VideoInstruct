   - Year
   - DOI
   - R Year
   - Level
   - Abstract

2. Format each header cell as bold to visually separate them from the data rows.
3. Adjust the width of each column so that the content is easily legible.
4. For columns like **Level** and **R Year**, set up a dropdown list using data validation:
   - For **Level**, add options such as `Basic`, `Intermediate`, and `Advanced` and use contrasting colors if desired.
   - For **R Year**, add options like `R1`, `R2`, `R3`, and `R4` and consider color coding them for extra clarity.

### 5. Populating the Spreadsheet with Article Data

For **each article** from the Radiographics page, perform the following steps:

1. **Extract and Record the Title**
   - Copy the title of the article from the article page.
   - Paste it into the appropriate cell under the *Title* column in your spreadsheet.

2. **Extract and Record the Author List**
   - Copy the author list from the article page. To avoid extra spaces or line breaks, paste it into the browser's address bar temporarily, then copy it again and paste into the spreadsheet under the *Author List* column.

3. **Extract and Record the Publication Year**
   - Manually type or copy the publication year (e.g., 2019) into the *Year* column.

4. **Extract and Record the DOI Link**
   - Copy the DOI link from the article page and paste it into the *DOI* column. This link is clickable and should remain as a URL.

5. **Set the Residency Year and Level**
   - In the *R Year* column, select the appropriate residency year from your dropdown (e.g., R1).
   - In the *Level* column, select the corresponding article level (e.g., Basic, Intermediate, or Advanced) from the dropdown menu you created.

6. **Extract and Record the Abstract**
   - Copy the article's abstract. If the abstract contains extra formatting (line breaks or unwanted characters), paste it first in the address bar of your browser to remove these extra characters, then copy it again.
   - Paste the cleaned abstract into the *Abstract* column. Adjust text wrapping settings if needed:
     - Ensure text wrapping is enabled so that the full abstract is visible without overflowing the cell.
     - If a shorter abstract view is desired, change the text wrapping to a shorter preset or disable it if necessary.

### 6. Final Spreadsheet Touches

1. Once all articles have been charted, remove or delete any extra empty rows to keep the spreadsheet uncluttered.
2. Double-check the spreadsheet for consistency:
   - Ensure all cells are visually aligned.
   - Confirm that dropdown menus are correctly applied in the *R Year* and *Level* columns.
   - Verify that text wrapping is enabled or disabled as per your visual preference, especially in the *Abstract* column.
3. Optionally, use cell formatting (like bolding titles or applying background colors) to enhance the visual appeal of the spreadsheet.
4. Save your changes. Your Google Spreadsheet is now ready for further processing or integration into your Python projects.
